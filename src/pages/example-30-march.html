    title="<a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news\">Brexit countdown</a>"
    content="It&rsquo;s begun. UK Prime Minister Theresa May has triggered &lsquo;Article 50&rsquo;, formally beginning the two-year process of Britain&rsquo;s exit from the European Union. The months since the Brexit vote last June have been a <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/brexit-government-s-anti-immigration-stance-spooks-uk-scientists-1.20755?WT.ec_id=NEWSDAILY-20170329\">turbulent time for scientists</a> — and things show no sign of calming. Nature looks at how Brexit is changing the lives of eight researchers — from a Cambridge experimental <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/how-brexit-is-changing-the-lives-of-eight-researchers-1.21714?WT.ec_id=NEWSDAILY-20170329#/gilmore\">philosopher who&rsquo;s probably out of a job</a>, to a Swedish <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/how-brexit-is-changing-the-lives-of-eight-researchers-1.21714?WT.ec_id=NEWSDAILY-20170329#/immler\">evolutionary biologist who&rsquo;s moving to the UK</a>."

    title="<a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news\">And on the other side of the pond...</a>"
    content="US President Donald Trump has signed a sweeping executive order to eliminate some of <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/obama-s-science-legacy-climate-policy-hots-up-1.20468?WT.ec_id=NEWSDAILY-20170329\">his predecessor&rsquo;s climate policies</a>. The long-anticipated action directs the US Environmental Protection Agency to repeal curbs on carbon emissions from power plants and to amend policies that might hamper domestic energy production. &ldquo;My administration is putting an end to the war on coal,&rdquo; Trump said during a signing ceremony. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have coal, really clean coal.&rdquo; The move is likely to face legal challenges."

    title="<a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news\">Cell-transplant first</a>"
    content="A Japanese man in his 60s has become the first person to receive cell transplants derived from another person&rsquo;s &lsquo;reprogrammed&rsquo; skin cells. Researchers in Kobe first reprogrammed the donor cells into stem cells (so-called &lsquo;iPS&rsquo; or induced pluripotent stem cells). Then they turned these into retinal cells and transplanted them into the man to treat macular degeneration, an eye disease which can lead to blindness. iPS cells offer the versatility of embryonic stem cells with fewer ethical difficulties. In 2014, in a similar procedure, a woman became the <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/japanese-woman-is-first-recipient-of-next-generation-stem-cells-1.15915?WT.ec_id=NEWSDAILY-20170328\">first person to receive tissue derived from iPS cells</a> — but the transplant material was created from her own cells. The use of &lsquo;banked&rsquo; donor cells may be faster and cheaper than deriving cells from patients each time."

    title="<a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news\">Octopus’s unusual breakfast</a>"
    content="Rare video footage from a deep-diving robot has for the first time revealed the diet of the elusive &lsquo;seven-arm&rsquo; octopus. The shy cephalopod (Haliphron atlanticus) eats something that looks remarkably like brunch — the egg-yolk jellyfish. The finding helps to scramble (apologies) the idea that gelatinous creatures such as jellyfish are nutritional dead-ends — a reputation that is slowly being overturned."

    title="<a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news\">Inspector bot</a>"
    content="A <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TrumpOrNotBot\">Twitter bot</a> is using machine learning techniques and natural language processing to work out when Donald Trump is personally writing tweets, and when his staff take the reigns. It used to be easy to tell, as Trump — notorious for his late-night pronouncements — was known to tweet from an Android phone, but Android-marked tweets have become a rare sight. The bot compares the language in presidential tweets to Trump&rsquo;s back catalogue. Quirks of spelling or punctuation (and mentions of &ldquo;media&rdquo;) are most likely to give the president away.

    title="<a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news\">Quantum heat</a>"
    content="The young field of quantum thermodynamics, which tries to reconcile modern quantum theory with familiar 19th century thermodynamics, is booming. Many physicists are trying to rebuild 200-year-old thermodynamic concepts of heat and energy for nanoscale systems, where quantum rules apply. They hope this will help to resolve whether the concepts of heat and efficiency apply to tiny electronic components and even atom-sized machines. But some researchers say this is the wrong approach, and new laws altogether are needed."
